                <p class="par" style="text-align: center;">A <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was making fun of the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u>
                one day for being so slow.</p>
                <p class="par" style="text-align: center;"> "Do you ever get anywhere?"he asked with a mocking laugh. </p>
                <p class="par" style="text-align: center;">"<u><b><span id="yes"></span></b></u>", replied the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> "but I get there <u>
                <b><span id="quick"></span></b></u> than you think. I'll run you a race prove it."</p>
                <p class="par" style="text-align: center;">The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was much <u><b><span id="alarm"></span></b></u> 
                at the idea of running a race with the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. 
                So the <u><b><span id="dog"></span></b></u>. who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<u><b><span id="exam"></span></b></u>".</p>
                <p class="par" style="text-align: center;">The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was soon far out of sight,and to make the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> 
                feel very deeply how rediculous it was for him to try a race with a <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u>. he went off the course to practice <u><b><span class="running"></span></b></u> for <u><b><span id="two"></span></b></u> hours until the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> should catch up.</p>
                <p class="par" style="text-align: center;">The <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily. and, after a time, passed the place where the <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was <u><b><span class="running"></span></b></u> .The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> was so caught up in <u><b><span class="running"></span></b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> was near the goal.The <u><b><span class="tiger"></span></b></u> now ran his swiftesy, but he could not overtake the <u><b><span class="lion"></span></b></u> in time.</p>
